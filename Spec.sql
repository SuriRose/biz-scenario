/* Hi, I'm the owner of a shoe store, called LA CHAUSSURE. We need an organized system to keep track of everything.
We heard such great things about your work, we know that you are the right person to help us out.

We need a record of style number, shoe style, size, color and company.
Every style number is different.
We need to know when the record was entered into the system, a date when shoes were purchased, how much they cost, when they were sold and for how much.
Another important detail, did the customer buy on sale or regular price.
Our return policy is same day money back and 30 day exchange, besides for sale items which can't be returned.
We also would like to know which employee served the customer so they can earn commission.
Another thing every shoe needs is a style number combined of first three letters of style, a dash, the last two letters of company and the first two letters of the color in uppercase.

Questions:
Q.Do you ever allow a customer to exchange a shoe after  30 days or return the next day ?
A.Sometimes customers try to return after the day they bought it, but it's against our policy.

Q. Do you ever donate shoes for free ?
A.Yes, sometimes, when the shoe didn't sell and is out of style.

Q.What is your most expensive pair of shoes that you sold ?
A.Our most expensive pair of shoes is 450.99, we never sell for a higher price than that.

Q.Are you particular about the timing of when the shoe was bought, in terms of returning or exchanging?
A.No, as long as it's within those 24 hours it's fine.

Reports:
1. We would like a list of all the inventory that sold within a month of purchase, in order of size and style.
2. We would like to give a bonus to the salesperson that brings in the most sales, show which salesperson that is.
3. Which style, sold the most, so we know what to reorder more of.
4. Which shoes got returned the most.
5. The amount of profit we earn on each pair of shoes.
6. The average amount of days it takes for inventory to be sold.
7. Which month people buy the most.
